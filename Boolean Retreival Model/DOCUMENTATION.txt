FILES DOCUMENTATION

The folder consists of three files

- Inverted_Index.py: This contains the implementation of inverted index and boolean query processing

- Positional_Index.py: This contains the implementation of positional index and proximity query processing

- model_main.py: Over here the main python gui is implemented and you need to run this file. Gui has been implemented
                 using Python's pygame library.

- CSV file is created when the code is run that maintains the positional index

- When you run the main python file a gui appears and in search bar you can type your query it could be either
  a Proximity query with format X Y /3 or a Boolean query with format X AND Y
